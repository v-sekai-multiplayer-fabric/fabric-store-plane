/-! # What the store underneath has to give

`ParallelCommit.lean` and `ReadAhead.lean` both say "the store" and mean FoundationDB. The
dependence is never written down, so it cannot be checked, and a second backend would have
to re-argue the whole protocol to be trusted.

This file writes it down. It states the store as an ordered byte keyspace with a handful of
laws, and then shows the two things the other specs actually need are consequences of the
laws and not of FoundationDB. A backend that meets the laws is substitutable; that is the
point, and it is why `substitutable` below is the theorem worth having.

The laws are deliberately few. Every `fdb_` call site in `fdb_vfs.c` is one of `get`,
`get_range`, `set`, `clear_range`, `commit`, `on_error` — no snapshot reads, no atomic
operations, no versionstamps, no watches, and no transaction options set anywhere. So the
surface below is not a simplification of what the VFS uses. It is what the VFS uses.

## Read-your-writes is not here, and should not be

No `*_body` in `fdb_vfs.c` reads a key it wrote in the same transaction. The only
read-after-write pairs are on disjoint keys — `resolve_body` writes PIDX and SIZE and then
reads LOGN — and no clear overlaps a preceding set: `finish_body` writes `SHARDN/<as_of>`
and clears `[SHARDN/0, SHARDN/<as_of>)`, an exclusive upper bound.

Leaving it out is not an oversight. The dirty-page buffer already is read-your-writes, at
the layer that owns uncommitted pages; providing it again in the store would be two sources
of truth for one page. And a body that could read its own writes is a body tempted to stay
open across a SQLite statement, which is fatal under FoundationDB's five second limit — a
limit handled nowhere in the tree, because every body is short instead.

## What this does not claim

It does not prove FoundationDB correct, and it does not prove SQLite correct, exactly as
`ParallelCommit.lean` proves neither. It reduces trusting a backend to arguing the laws
below, instead of re-arguing the protocol above them.

/-! ## The keyspace

A key is bytes, and the order is the order of the bytes. `fdb_keys.h` puts every number in
a key big endian precisely so that this order is the order of the numbers, and
`fuzz/keys_test.cc` holds that property. So the ordering below is the one assumption this
file makes about keys, and it is checked elsewhere rather than here. -/

abbrev Key := List UInt8
abbrev Val := List UInt8

/-- Strict lexicographic order on bytes: the order `memcmp` gives, which is the order
FoundationDB gives its keyspace and the order SQLite gives a `BLOB` primary key. A shorter
key that is a prefix of a longer one comes first. -/
def lexLt : Key → Key → Bool
  | [], [] => false
  | [], _ :: _ => true
  | _ :: _, [] => false
  | a :: as, b :: bs => if a == b then lexLt as bs else a < b

def lexLe (x y : Key) : Bool := x == y || lexLt x y

/-- Half open, the way every range in `fdb_vfs.c` is: `[lo, hi)`. -/
def inRange (lo hi k : Key) : Bool := lexLe lo k && lexLt k hi

/-! The ordering is the one place this spec touches something a real store must agree with,
so it is worth pinning to the check that was actually run against SQLite. These are the same
six keys, in the same order `SELECT ... ORDER BY k` returned them. -/

example : lexLt [0] [0, 0] = true := by decide
example : lexLt [0, 0] [1] = true := by decide
example : lexLt [1] [0x7f, 0x80] = true := by decide
example : lexLt [0x7f, 0x80] [0xff] = true := by decide
example : lexLt [0xff] [0xff, 0xff] = true := by decide

/-- `key_after`, which FoundationDB calls `strinc`, exists so that a prefix scan is a range.
Nothing below needs its definition, only that a prefix range is a range. -/
example : inRange [1] [2] [1, 0, 0] = true := by decide

/-! ## The store

A function from keys to values, in the shape `ReadAhead.Store` already uses: a real store is
finite, but nothing here counts keys, and a function keeps the proofs to `simp`. -/

structure Store where
  find : Key → Option Val

/-- What a range read answers.

`covered` is which keys came back, not which keys exist. That distinction is the whole
content of `ReadAhead.Slot`: a key the read did not return is not a key that is not there.
`more` is FoundationDB's own flag, and it is the only honest way to say which of the two a
caller is looking at. -/
structure Ranged where
  covered : Key → Bool
  more : Bool

/-- The operations, and there are only four. `commit` and `on_error` are about transactions
rather than the keyspace, and they appear in `Commit` below. -/
structure Backend where
  get : Store → Key → Option Val
  getRange : Store → Key → Key → Nat → Bool → Ranged

  clearRange : Store → Key → Key → Store

  /-- A write is visible at the key it wrote. -/

  /-- And nowhere else. -/
  set_is_local : ∀ s k v j, j ≠ k → (b.set s k v).find j = s.find j
  /-- A clear empties its range. -/
  clear_empties : ∀ s lo hi k, inRange lo hi k = true → (b.clearRange s lo hi).find k = none

  just wrote. -/

  /-- Only keys in the range come back. -/
  range_is_sound : ∀ s lo hi n rev k,
    (b.getRange s lo hi n rev).covered k = true → inRange lo hi k = true
  /-- **`more = false` means the range was covered.** This is the law `ReadAhead.lean` is
  about and the one `query_intent_body` does not honour. -/
  range_is_complete : ∀ s lo hi n rev k,
    (b.getRange s lo hi n rev).more = false →
    inRange lo hi k = true → s.find k ≠ none →
    (b.getRange s lo hi n rev).covered k = true

/-! ## A commit is all of it or none of it

The property `prove_crash.c` looks for, and the one `PRAGMA integrity_check` cannot see: a
database holding pages from two commits is structurally perfect and still wrong.

Stating it as a relation with exactly two constructors is the statement. There is no third
outcome, so there is no torn store to reason about. -/

/-! ## The fence only ever rises

`TemporalTSCacheProperties`, and `ParallelCommit.fence_never_falls` is the same fact about
the protocol. Here it is the obligation on the store that makes it true: a write transaction
reads the fence, and it may only commit if the fence did not move meanwhile.

`fdb_vfs.c` gets this from a plain non-snapshot `get`, which registers a read conflict.
A local backend gets it from `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, which takes the write lock before the read,
so no other writer exists to move it. Different mechanisms, one law. -/

/-- The keys a transaction read, and the rule for whether it may commit. -/
def conflictFree (s s' : Store) (reads : List Key) : Prop :=
  ∀ k ∈ reads, s'.find k = s.find k

/-- A transaction that read a key and committed saw that key unchanged. Immediate from the
definition, and it is the definition that matters: it is what `check_fence` is buying. -/
theorem fence_was_not_moved {s s' : Store} {reads : List Key} {f : Key}
    (h : conflictFree s s' reads) (hf : f ∈ reads) : s'.find f = s.find f := by
  unfold conflictFree at h
  exact h f hf

/-! ## Two backends

Both are stated as what the system provides, not as an implementation. The difference
between them is exactly one thing: whether a range read can come back short. -/

/-- A backend whose range reads always cover the range they were asked for.

This is the local SQLite store. A range read is one `SELECT` over a `BLOB` primary key with
no transaction size cap above it, so there is nothing to truncate against. -/
def complete : Backend where
  get := fun s k => s.find k
  getRange := fun _ lo hi _ _ => { covered := inRange lo hi, more := false }
  set := fun s k v => ⟨fun j => if j = k then some v else s.find j⟩
  clearRange := fun s lo hi => ⟨fun j => if inRange lo hi j then none else s.find j⟩

/-- A backend whose range reads may come back short.

This is FoundationDB. A transaction is capped at 10 MB, so a range over a megabyte of pages
answers with what fitted and sets `more`. `fits` is which keys came back, and `cutShort` is
whether this particular range was cut — the flag the C actually reads.

An earlier version of this model set `more` unconditionally. That made `range_is_complete`
vacuous, and it said something false: FoundationDB *does* promise it covered the range when
it does not set `more`, and the C is entitled to rely on that. Modelling the flag as always
true would have let a backend that never covers anything satisfy the laws, which is not a
store the layout could run on. `honest` below ties the two together, so the law is carried
rather than dodged. -/
def truncating (fits : Key → Bool) (cutShort : Key → Key → Bool) : Backend where
  get := complete.get
  getRange := fun _ lo hi _ _ =>
    { covered := fun k => inRange lo hi k && fits k, more := cutShort lo hi }
  set := complete.set
  clearRange := complete.clearRange

/-- What a range read has to mean by not setting `more`: everything in the range came back.
That is the whole content of the flag, and it is the obligation `query_intent_body` drops
when it stops at 4096 rows without looking. -/

/-- **The flag is not decoration.** When the read did cut short, a key that is in the range
and in the store can still be missing from what came back — which is exactly the state
`ReadAhead.ignoring_more_loses_a_page` turns into a wrong page.

/-! ## Transport: the store's laws are what the protocol was assuming

`ParallelCommit.lean` records a live defect. `query_intent_body` enumerates a participant's
staged pages with a range read, stops at 4096, and ignores `more`; `resolve_body` writes a
PIDX row for exactly the pages it was handed and then advances the head regardless. A page
left out has no index row, so a read falls through to the shard and finds the version from
before the commit, and `truncated_resolve_reads_the_old_page` is that.

The obligation it left is `indexesEverything`. Below, that obligation is discharged by
`range_is_complete` — so it was never a fact about FoundationDB, it was a fact about
whether the enumeration finished. -/

/-- Where a participant's staged pages live: one key for each page, all inside one range,
because DELTA is keyed by txid and then page number. -/

/-- The same fact in the words `ParallelCommit.lean` uses, so it discharges the obligation

/-! ## What the local backend earns

On FoundationDB the hypothesis `more = false` is a real obligation: the 10 MB cap means a
range over a large commit can come back short, and the C has to notice. On a backend whose
range reads always finish, the hypothesis is discharged once and for all, and the defect
`truncated_resolve_reads_the_old_page` describes cannot arise.

That is not a claim about tidier code. It is a class of bug that stops existing. -/

    (complete.getRange s lo hi n rev).more = false := rfl

    (complete_never_truncates s L.lo L.hi n rev) d tx holds p hp

/-! ## Transport: the read side

`ReadAhead.readVia_fillUpTo` proves a window is safe for *any* covered set, so read-ahead
needs nothing from the store beyond soundness — a prefetch may waste a round trip and may
not change an answer. What it does need is that the covered set is honest about what it
covers, and that is `range_is_sound`: a key the read did not return is `unfetched`, never
`absent`.

So the obligation the store carries on the read side is only this: do not report a key as
covered when it was not in the range asked for. -/

theorem covered_stays_in_range (b : Backend) (hb : Laws b) (s : Store)
    (lo hi : Key) (n : Nat) (rev : Bool) (k : Key)
    (h : (b.getRange s lo hi n rev).covered k = true) : inRange lo hi k = true :=
  hb.range_is_sound s lo hi n rev k h

/-- Read-ahead is safe over any backend, because it is safe over any covered set. The window
`fillUpTo` builds from a range read cannot change an answer, whichever backend filled it. -/

/-! ## The theorem this file exists for -/

/-- **Substitutable.** A backend meeting the laws carries the store plane: an enumeration
that finished indexes every staged page, a resolve over it is honest, a covered key really
was in the range, a commit is one of its two ends, and read-ahead cannot change an answer.

Nothing in the list mentions FoundationDB. That is the content: what the layout above needs
is the laws, and a store that meets them is the same store as far as anything here can tell.
Choosing between them is then a deployment question — cross-machine handoff against a commit
that costs an fsync rather than a round trip — and not a correctness one. -/
