# Check that the store plane calls the FoundationDB surface it says it calls.
#
#   check_surface.sh <build-dir>
#
# `foundationdb.allow` beside this script lists the C ABI the plane uses and says why each
# absence is an absence. This checks the list against reality, because a list nothing checks
# goes stale and the stale copy still reads as authoritative — the same argument
# `weft/limits.hpp` makes about its transcribed numbers.
#
# Two checks, because there are two ways to leave the surface.
#
# One: a new symbol. Read from the built library rather than from the source, so a call
# reached through a macro or an inline function is still caught. `fdb_select_api_version` is
# exactly that case: the macro expands to `fdb_select_api_version_impl`, and only the
# linker's view knows it.
#
# Two: a snapshot read. That one is not a symbol at all — it is the trailing argument to
# `fdb_transaction_get` and the third argument after the streaming mode in
# `fdb_transaction_get_range`, and it must stay zero. Reading the fence non-snapshot is what
# registers the read conflict that makes FoundationDB reject a write whose fence moved, so a
# snapshot read in the wrong place disables ownership and nothing fails loudly. That is the
# same blind spot `prove_crash` exists for, arriving through the type system's back door.
#
# Why this matters beyond tidiness: `spec/Backend.lean` proves what the layout needs is
# seven laws and not FoundationDB, which is what lets a local backend carry the same store.
# The proof holds only while the C stays inside the surface the laws describe.
