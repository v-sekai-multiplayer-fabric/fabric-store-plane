# Prove a FoundationDB cluster tolerates a zone loss, by taking one away.
#
# Stage 1 is the cluster's opinion of itself and proves almost nothing on its own. Stages 3
# to 7 are observations, and they are what the claim rests on: a store that reports fault
# tolerance and then loses data when a zone dies was lying, and only killing the zone finds
# that out. `prove_crash.c` exists for the same reason at process scale.
#
# Every wait names a state and observes it. See `wait.sh` for why there are no sleeps.
#
# Ports 4701-4703, so it never collides with a cluster already running on this machine.
